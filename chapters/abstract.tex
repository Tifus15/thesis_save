\chapter*{Abstract}
The introduction of the adjoint method for NeuralODEs\cite{neuralODE} has created new ways for physics-based trajectory predictions. In the subsequent chapters of this thesis, we look at deep learning models and methods targeted at predicting physical systems' behavior. We use the guiding light of Hamiltonian equations to dive into systems such as the harmonic oscillator and the three-body problem. We are intrigued with exploring graph neural networks' ability to be used in physics informed models: in the N-body problem and in the N-pendulum. This work tests the ability of graph neural networks to generalize the behavior from single realizations of elements at the node level of the graph. In this way, we hope to exemplify how such models can capture highly dynamic physical processes.
